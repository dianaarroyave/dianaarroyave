Passionate about new technologies, with the ability to integrate customer needs with Full Stack development (JavaScript, NodeJS, HTML5, CSS, React, Git, GitHub, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, APIs)

My experience of more than 17 years in communications, public relations, marketing, social media, digital marketing and sales, has allowed me to have a comprehensive understanding of the needs of companies, which I currently apply to web development.
